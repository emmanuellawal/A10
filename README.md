Cookies are text files used to record the information of a computer. As long as 
that computer has a browser open onto a website, cookies will also be used to 
customize and tailor our interactions. Actions like that include saving login 
information and personalizing our website experience.

Cookies are bits of data that are sent back and forth from the browser to 
identify you.The data appears as strings of numbers and letters in a text file. 
For every website opened, a new cookie is created and placed temporarily in a 
folder on said device. Some of the pros and cons to cookies are listed below:

Pros
Website Personailzation - Cookies allow websites to remember your preferences and settings, enhancing your browsing experience.

Efficient User authentication - Cookies can streamline the login process on websites

User-Friendly Website Layouts - Cookies can recognize the preferred user layouts in an website benefitting even users who have accessibility needs

Cross-Device Consistency - Cookies can assist in maintaining a consistent user experience across multiple devices in situations where login is necessary and uses a cookie to identify you

Cons
Privaxy Concerns - Third-party cookies can potentially track user's online activity across multiple websites erecting extremly detailed profiles

Security Vulnerabilities - Although rather harmless, cookies can be exploited by malicious external entities

Cookie Overload - cookies are accumulated as more websites are visted, leading to a cluttered cookie store and slow down web browsing

Legal and Compliance Issues - there are regulatiions strictly enforced upon the use of cookies and failure to comply can result in hefty fines and legal repurcussions

In terms of the word ethical, I wholeheartedly beleive that cookies can be seen as ethical but it is all based on how the information would be used. From reading about its purpose, it poses as something harmless but you must account for human interference. So my opinion fimrly stands that it lies on the near center of the balance between ethical and non-ethical.
