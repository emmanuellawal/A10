Cookies are text files used to record the information of a computer. As long as 
that computer has a browser open onto a website, cookies will also be used to 
customize and tailor our interactions. Actions like that include saving login 
information and personalizing our website experience.

Cookies are bits of data that are sent back and forth from the browser to 
identify you.The data appears as strings of numbers and letters in a text file. 
For every website opened, a new cookie is created and placed temporarily in a 
folder on said device. Some of the pros and cons to cookies are listed below:

Pros
Website Personailzation
Efficient User authentication
User-Friendly Website Layouts
Cross-Device Consistency

Cons
Privaxy Concerns
Security Vulnerabilities
Cookie Overload
Legal and Compliance Issues

In terms of the word ethical, I wholeheartedly beleive that cookies can be seen as ethical but it is all based on how the information would be used. From reading about its purpose, it poses as something harmless but you must account for human interference.
